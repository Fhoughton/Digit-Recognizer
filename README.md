# Digit-Recognizer

This was a convoluted neural network created for the [Digit Recognizer](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer) competition on Kaggle. In the competition it scored a perfect score of 1.00000, placing me in the top 2% of participants. It uses both the provided competition dataset and the [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) for training.
